# hack-assembler
Implementation of an assembler for the 16-bit Hack Assmebly Language. 

## Hack Assembly Language
The language that is used as part of the course Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nant to Tetris (Project-Centered Course) https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home-welcome.
Language Specification can be found in *Elements of Computing Systems* by Nisan and Schocken, MIT Press.


## Concepts acquired:
* The script was written in July/August 2020 only after two weeks of transitioning to Python from C and with minimal knowledge of the Hack Assembly Language.
* Although not necessarily complex, this project introduced me to various programming concepts such as string processing and regular expressions
* In its current form, the script can only handle programs that contain *no symbols*
* A complete assembler is being developed.
